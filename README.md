# Welcome to my workout tracking app!

## Current Functionality

As of right now, the workout tracker is capable of logging simple workouts and displaying the users data back to them. It's a simple CRUD app that I built to test my abilities in react as well as my capacity to learn and apply new technologies and skills, such as hosting, authentication, and using Firebase. I also gained experience with Material UI to build the user interface, and ended up learning a lot about managing state in react. 

## Features to Come

This application is far from complete - this is the first iteration, as it is currently unable to handle more complex workouts/exercises or display progress effectively. The next steps will include a way to visualize progress in key exercise, ideally using some sort of graphical technologies, as well as incorporating support for more complex workouts, such as supersets and dropsets for a better experience.
